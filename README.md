This repository contains a simple Java program that demonstrates common runtime exceptions.  The `UncommonErrorExample.java` file shows examples of `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`, `NullPointerException`, and `ArithmeticException`.  The `UncommonErrorSolution.java` file provides example solution that handles these exceptions gracefully.  This is a useful example to understand how to handle unexpected situations in Java applications.
